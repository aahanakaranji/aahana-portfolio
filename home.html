          <b>Hi! My name is Aahana Karanji! </b>
          <p class="aboutMeInfoPara">
            I am a 17-year-old who has been playing piano since I was 9. I like
            to read and listen to music. I am studying to be a software
            programmer, in fact, I made this website! I am a junior at Etowah
            High School, and I live in Eagle Watch.
          </p>
          <p class="aboutMeInfoPara">
            I love playing piano with all my heart! Piano has been a huge part
            of my life. Even indirectly, piano has helped me with other areas
            like math, language skills, my attention and memory, and improved my
            fine motor skills, like typing faster!
          </p>
          <p class="aboutMeInfoPara">
            My piano journey started in the third grade. I had always loved
            playing on my old keyboard, so I wanted to learn officially. I
            started my lessons, and I loved them! I still remember the first
            song I ever learnt, Hot Cross Buns. I remember my first piano
            recital, it was terrifying but I loved it. However, my songs were
            short and took me less than 30 seconds, so that probably helped my
            first ever experience.
          </p>
          <p class="aboutMeInfoPara">
            Other than piano, I love to watch movies with my mother, read books,
            learn about history, and listen to a variety of genres of music.
            Growing up, I loved Harry Potter and Percy Jackson, but now my
            reading had reduced, because I spend more time programming and
            studying physics.
